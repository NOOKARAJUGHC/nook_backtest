Chose survival over ego
A strategy that lets you sleep is better than a strategy that looks good.
Your entry has short-term direction, but not instant momentum.

1. Small profits but Big losses
2. Should I use SL or wait till EOD
3. Should I stick to 1 trade per day
4. Should I test the Trailing profit and SL
5. Should I test the EMA combos
6. Am I misunderstanding the FEES and Slippage?
7. Can I beat the fees , if I do multiple per day?
8. In algo trading are trades checking by minute candles or second by second?
9. Should I go for SL even if it reduces the WinRate ? I think this cannot be the ISSUE if I do more than 2trades daily?
10. Should I try different TP and SL ?
11. Should I exit if no TP in 10 minutes?
12.
